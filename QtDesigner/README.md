# Project Title: My House's Inventory 
#### Video Demo: [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/)
#### Inspiration: 
Everytime I'm at Costco with my wife, we end up forgetting or arguing about what we still have left at home, and, in my opinion, we end up buying more than we need!     

me: "we don't need more saran wrap"  
her: "yes, we do, we're running out"  
*thinking to myself*: I wish I had an inventory that shows what we currently have at home to win this arguement*

In this project, I created a GUI (graphical user interface), that display a list of items currently available in my house. For the GUI layout design, I took inspiration from a MMOPRG (Massive Multiplayer Open Role Playing Game) game's inventory. In this case, I took inspiration from my childhood's favorite MMORPG - MapleStory. The inventory from MapleStory looks like this:

My inventory GUI will be similar to this, it will have tabs for each different category (in the image above, there are "EQUIP, USE, ETC., SET-UP, CASH, DEC." tabs). 
Each tab will display/house items that should belong in that category. 

Ultimately, it is up to the user to decide what items they want to put in their inventory and what category those items should belong in. After all, the user should create an inventory that best suits them.

## Description: 
Most, if not all, of this project was written using OOP (object oriented programming). The reason why I decided on this was because:
1. I learned that games are written using OOP because characters and items share attributes, and using OOP is a powerful way to create many unique characters and items that share an inherent trait. For example, every game character has a health bar and a mana bar. Obviously, this isn't a game project and has nothing to do with building a game, but using MMORPG was a great way for me to visualize how OOP works.  
2. I wanted to get more practice and exposure to OOP. 
I will attempt to explain how the core principles of OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) was used in my project.
